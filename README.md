**Abstract**

This project analyzes the various areas of expenditure that college students face, such as tuition, accommodation, books, and personal expenses. With rising education costs, especially for middle-class families, proper financial planning is essential to avoid debt and ensure uninterrupted education. The project uses Python and libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize student expenditure data from three different countries through pie charts, bar plots, and scatter plots. The aim is to help students and parents understand and manage college expenses more effectively, highlighting the importance of budgeting and awareness of available financial aids.

Project Focus:
The project focuses on analyzing the monthly expenditure of college students from three different countries.

Purpose:
To understand and visualize how students spend money on essential needs like tuition, accommodation, food, books, transportation, and other personal expenses.

Problem Addressed:
The cost of education is rising, making it difficult for middle-class families to manage college-related expenses.
Lack of financial planning can lead to unnecessary debt or dropping out of college.

Goal:
To help students and parents identify major expense areas.
To promote financial planning and awareness of available aid and scholarships.
To visually compare expenses across different countries for better insights.

Data Used:
A sample dataset showing the percentage distribution of student expenses in three countries (Country A, B, and C).
Expense categories: Accommodation, Food, Books, Leisure, Others.

Technology Stack:
Python (Programming Language)
Pandas (Data handling)
Matplotlib (Data visualization)

Graphical Representations Included:
Pie Charts: Show expense distribution per country.
Bar Plots: Compare expenses across all three countries.
Scatter Plots: Show individual expense points per country.
Tools and Platform:

Python IDE (IDLE)
CSV file for data storage
Windows OS with necessary hardware requirements

Future Scope:
Can be enhanced using large databases like Oracle.
Can be turned into a budget planning tool for students.
